    A light-emitting diode (LED) is a semiconductor light source
    that emits light when current flows through it.
    Electrons in the semiconductor recombine with electron holes,
    releasing energy in the form of photons.
    The color of the light (corresponding to the energy of the photons)
    is determined by the energy required for electrons to cross
    the band gap of the semiconductor.[5] White light is obtained
    by using multiple semiconductors or a layer of light-emitting phosphor
    on the semiconductor device.[6]
