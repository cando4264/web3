    Electronic paper, also sometimes electronic ink,
    e-ink or electrophoretic display, are display devices
    that mimic the appearance of ordinary ink on paper.
    [1] Unlike conventional flat panel displays that emit light,
    electronic paper displays reflect light like paper.
    This may make them more comfortable to read,
    and provide a wider viewing angle than most light-emitting displays.
    The contrast ratio in electronic displays available
    as of 2008 approaches newspaper, and newly (2008)
    developed displays are slightly better.[2]
    An ideal e-paper display can be read in direct sunlight
    without the image appearing to fade.
